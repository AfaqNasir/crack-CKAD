# crack-CKAD
A four week plan for beginners to crack CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) exam by Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
I have prepared this course based on my own Kubernetes certification that I completed in four weeks. 

### Pre-requisities

There is no pre-requisites apart from software development experience. 
There is no experience on docker or container required.

### Week 1 (Build Concept)

This week focus on building concepts. I found following course great to start with. 
[Learn DevOps: The Complete Kubernetes Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-devops-the-complete-kubernetes-course/)

### Week 2 (Concept -50%, Pratice - 50%)

For this week you should continue to build concept while start practicing.
Following course provides a good platform for you to practice. 
[Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests](https://www.udemy.com/certified-kubernetes-application-developer)

### Week 3 (Concept - 20%, Practice - 80%) 

Now its enough of concepts now and time to go full time into hands on exercises. 
Spend this week doing [CKAD exercises](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises). 
Make sure you do it yourself and type out the solution before checking the anwsers given.
Now you have gone through the whole CKAD curriculum, concepts and done enough hands-on.
You can take [Kubernetes Challenge](https://kodekloud.com/p/practice-test-kubernetes-challenge-1-wordpress) now.
You should feel good to schedule an exam for next week. 

### Week 4 (Revision, Exam preparation)

For final revision, I would advise going through following free resources.
